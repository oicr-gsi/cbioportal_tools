This folder probably won't change much.

## Config.py
This script contains the data structure definition for the Config objects that are used to manage the data that is imported in cBioPortal.
It also contains a few functions for retrieval of said objects.

## helper.py
This contains some basic functions as well as a few functions that are used across `data_types`. This might change a little?

## cancer_colours.csv
Because cBioPortal wants colours for cancer types, I use this to generate non-conflicting cancer colours, that are also reproducible.
