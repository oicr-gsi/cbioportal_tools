# Constants
- Ensure that the appropriate information for the _meta_, _config_, and _case_list_ is in the correct variables in [`constants.py`](../constants/constants.py)
  - `meta_info_map`
    - Writes the generic data in the `meta_<type>.txt` file
  - `args2config_map`
    - To support the specification of the location of the type_config file in the command line arguments
  - `config2name_map`
    - Gives the respective name to the `meta_{}.txt` and `data_{}.txt` files for a given type
    - Can be arbitrary
  - `case_list_map`
    - gives correct `case_list` id for given data_type
    - Honestly I'm a little lost as to how this affects the actual study since case lists still show up regardless of them existing in this map.
